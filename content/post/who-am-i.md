In my [professional life](http://lnkd.in/dpcE8SZ), I'm a Director of
Infrastructure for [AltSchool](https://www.altschool.com).  In non-manager
speak that means I lead complex projects that are important and impactful to
our whole engineering team.

I also pinch hit as an individual contributor, though perhaps the most
important thing I can do for our success is recognize and support other great
individual contributors.

Did I mention that [AltSchool is hiring](https://www.altschool.com/jobs)?

I used to work at [Google](https://www.google.com), another great company.
When I got there in 2005, it was a few thousand people, and when I left it had
grown over 10x.  I loved it there, but I left to try to innovate a $T+
addressable market that doesn't look much different
[now](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=classroom+1910) from [100 years
ago](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=classroom+1910) with a really
excellent team.

I live in [Fort
Greene](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fort+Greene,+Brooklyn,+NY/) with my
wife Sarah and our dog Oscar.  I like taking pictures and have lately tried my
hand at homebrewing.
