                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>I learned how to hire while I worked for Google, a company that has an enviable
number of great engineers.  They frequently rank in the <a href="http://www.greatplacetowork.com/best-companies/100-best-companies-to-work-for">top places to
work</a>,
but when I left the thing I missed the most was not the free food or the
generous vacation.  I missed the people.</p>

<p>How did Google get so many great engineers?  I&rsquo;ve heard it said that great
problems attract great people.  I&rsquo;ve also heard it said that great people
attract great people.  I actually think they just hire great people.</p>

<p>So, if you want to emulate their success, what should you do?</p>

<p>Whenever you measure a population, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">bell
curve</a> is bound to come up.
The bell curve is used to measure underlying processes that have an outcome
that&rsquo;s the sum of many small random events.  You can probably safely assume
that your measure of &ldquo;employee quality&rdquo; will look like a bell curve.  You can
also probably safely assume your applicant&rsquo;s interview scores will also look
like a bell curve.</p>

<p>By changing policies and processes, you can increase the accuracy of the hiring
decision.  The name of the game here is increasing the correlation between
&ldquo;employee quality&rdquo; and applicant interview score.  They&rsquo;ll both still look like
a bell curve when viewed independently, but when plotted against one another
the relationship becomes obvious.</p>

<p>By changing the number of applicants you reject, you bias the result toward the
ones that are of &ldquo;employee quality.&rdquo;  Notice that in the <em>p=0</em> graph above, the
right side of the graph looks like it has the same mean on the <em>y</em> axis as the
left side of the graph.  However, if you divide the <em>p=1</em> graph, the right side
will have a much higher mean than the left side.</p>

<p>How do these factors relate to each other?  I put together a quick random
simulation to determine exactly that.  Unfortunately at a sample size of 100 it
was too difficult to read, so the following represents what happens when hiring
1,000 employees.</p>

<p>Two things stand out to me immediately.</p>

<p>If you want a chance of hiring an organization that performs in the 90th+
percentile, you need an accuracy of at least 50%.  Your interview questions
need to be topical to the job function, demonstrable skills need to be
demonstrated, and you should try to get information from multiple interviewers.</p>

<p>But, you also need a bias of at least 75%!  In other words, you have to say
&ldquo;no&rdquo; to at least 3 out of 4 candidates, regardless of how accurate you think
your process is.  Looking at the slope, it&rsquo;s clear that bias becomes even more
important than accuracy as you try to exceed the 90th+ percentile of
performance.</p>

<p>Applicants should understand that great organizations are built by having high
precision but low recall.</p>
